## Mockup

The following images shows the website in play!

## Resources-used

* <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1E08i2UJGI" target="_blank"> A React tutorial from Brian Design was used as guidance for this project. </a> 

* <a href="https://github.com/briancodex/react-todo-app-v1" target="_blank"> The creator's GitHub repo can be found at his handle @briancodex.</a> 

## Future-plans

In the future, I would like make task completion more intutive by adding as React icon to click instead of clicking on the entire task. 

I also plan to host this project somewhere for easier viewing.
